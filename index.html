    <p>Hi my name is Meyer and I made a website. It's probably not very impressive, but it's mine.</p>

    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/meyergulledge/home">This is actually my second website, technically.</a>

    <p class="cheese-class">Earlier today I had a slice of cheesecake. It was a bit much for me; it was an oreo cheesecake, which I liked, but the "body" of the cheesecake went a little overboard. The oreo crust was good and the toppings were good, I just wish the main cheesecake part was simpler.</p>
    <p class="cheese-class">So, in summary, regarding the cheesecake:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It was not easy to finish</li>
      <li>The crust was bomb</li>
      <li>The body was too much</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="cheese-class">My steps for improving the cheesecake:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start the recipe with less complex body ingredients</li>
      <li>Use strong textural and flavorful toppings, but don't use too much</li>
      <li>Balance the sugar. Make repeated cake trials if neccesary to do this</li>
    </ol>
